# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a React adaptation of Angular's Tour of Heroes available here: 
[live example](https://opii972.github.io/react-tour-of-heroes-app/#/). \
To see the original version: [live example](https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/toh-pt6/stackblitz.html) / 
[download example](https://angular.io/generated/zips/toh-pt6/toh-pt6.zip).

Please note, this project is not a comparison between these two technologies but 
only **my vision** of the excellent Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial project 
written with React. \
This project is for Front-End developers who learned Angular first and are curious 
about developing Web Applications using React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please note, in my demo application, you can't add more than 15 heroes and log messages are limited to 15.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.\
Please note that the project not includes tests for this demo!

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
